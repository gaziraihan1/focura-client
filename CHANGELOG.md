# Changelog

All notable changes to the Focura client are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Automation rules can now be run manually ("Run now") against any task in the workspace via `POST /api/v1/automations/:id/test`
- Rule builder UX: team-member picker for ASSIGN_USER, explicit project-owner/actor role dropdown, resolved action summaries, per-rule pending states, and project-scope badges in the rule list
- Added a cookie-consent banner — Google Analytics now loads only after explicit opt-in
- Added Data Export and Account Deletion to Settings — matching the promises in the legal pages

### Changed
- Automations moved from global Settings into **Workspace Settings → Automations** (`/dashboard/workspaces/:slug/settings?tab=automations`); the global Settings entry now links to each workspace's rules

### Planned for v1.2.0
- Notification streams now authenticate with a short-lived, single-use token minted per connection (`/api/v1/notifications/sse-token`), carried through the session via exchange/refresh; idle streams stay alive with data-carrying heartbeats

- Wellness & capacity tracking, burnout dashboard, analytics with date-range filters and CSV export
- Two-factor authentication UI

### Changed
- Framer Motion standardization across the app; dynamic Open Graph images; redesigned landing/settings pages; accessibility and keyboard navigation improvements
- Privacy, Cookie, and Terms pages rewritten to match the product (real cookie list, correct providers, honest consent wording)

### Fixed
- Dashboard, task-filtering, and error-handling fixes across the app (167 commits since v1.0.0-stable)
