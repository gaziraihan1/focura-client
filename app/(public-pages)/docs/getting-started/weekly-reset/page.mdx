# Weekly Reset

The Weekly Reset is how you prevent your system from becoming noisy, overloaded, or outdated.

During the week, tasks accumulate, priorities shift, and unfinished work creates mental pressure.
The reset is a short ritual that restores **clarity and control** before the next cycle begins.

This is not a long planning session.
It is a **maintenance routine**.

---

## The Purpose

The Weekly Reset helps you:

* Clear completed or irrelevant tasks
* Re-evaluate priorities
* Reduce mental clutter
* Start the next week with a clean focus

Without a reset, most productivity systems slowly turn into storage instead of execution tools.

---

## When to Do It

Choose a consistent time:

* End of work week
* Sunday evening
* Before your next work cycle

Consistency matters more than the exact day.

The reset should take **10–15 minutes**, not an hour.

---

## The 5-Step Weekly Reset

Follow the same sequence every week.

---

### 1. Close What Is Finished

* Mark completed tasks
* Close or archive finished projects
* Acknowledge progress

This creates a clear psychological reset.

---

### 2. Clean Up Loose Tasks

Look for:

* Tasks that no longer matter
* Duplicates
* Ideas you captured but won’t act on

Delete or archive them.

Your task list should represent **current reality**, not past intentions.

---

### 3. Review Unfinished Work

For remaining tasks, decide:

* Continue next week
* Break into smaller tasks
* Remove if no longer relevant

Avoid carrying vague tasks forward.

---

### 4. Reconfirm Priorities

Ask one question:

**What actually moves things forward next week?**

Select:

* 1–3 meaningful priorities
* Not everything that feels urgent

This step protects your upcoming daily focus.

---

### 5. Prepare a Light Starting Point

Set up:

* One clear first task for the next workday
* A short, realistic task list

The goal is to start the week without hesitation.

---

## What the Reset Is NOT

The Weekly Reset is not:

* A full planning session
* A time to redesign your workflow
* A place to add dozens of new tasks

If your reset keeps expanding, your system is becoming too heavy.

---

## Signs You Need a Reset

You will notice:

* Task list feels overwhelming
* Many outdated items
* Unclear priorities
* Frequent task switching

These are signals that your system needs cleaning, not more structure.

---

## The Psychological Effect

A proper reset creates:

* A sense of closure
* Reduced background stress
* Clear starting direction
* Confidence in your system

You begin the next week without carrying unresolved mental load.

---

## Recommended Frequency

* Once per week is enough for most users
* High-intensity projects may benefit from a shorter midweek cleanup

More frequent resets usually indicate over-planning.

---

## What Happens Next

Once you run weekly resets consistently, your system stays:

* Light
* Accurate
* Actionable

From here, the next step is learning how to avoid common early mistakes that break focus.
