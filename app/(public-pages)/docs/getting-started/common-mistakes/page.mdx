# Common Mistakes

These are the most frequent patterns that reduce clarity, slow execution, and break the focus system inside Focura.

Avoiding them will immediately improve how effective the workspace feels.

---

## 1. Turning Focura Into a Storage Dump

**Mistake**

Adding everything you think of as tasks.

Examples:

* Random ideas
* Someday goals
* Notes that are not actionable

**Why it hurts**

Focura is designed for **execution**, not passive storage.
When everything becomes a task, nothing feels urgent.

**Correct approach**

* Tasks must be **actionable**
* If it cannot be done → move it to:

  * Notes
  * Ideas
  * Backlog

---

## 2. Creating Too Many Active Projects

**Mistake**

Running 6–10 projects at the same time.

**Why it hurts**

Context switching destroys momentum and increases mental load.

**Correct approach**

* Keep **1–3 active projects**
* Archive or pause the rest
* Focus on finishing, not starting

---

## 3. Skipping the Daily Focus

**Mistake**

Working directly from the full task list.

**Why it hurts**

Large lists create anxiety and decision fatigue.

**Correct approach**

Every day:

* Select **3–5 priority tasks**
* Move them to **Daily Focus**
* Ignore the rest

---

## 4. Writing Vague Tasks

**Bad Examples**

* “Work on project”
* “Improve UI”
* “Fix bugs”

**Why it hurts**

Your brain cannot start vague work.

**Correct approach**

Make tasks **atomic and specific**:

* “Design dashboard card layout”
* “Fix login JWT refresh issue”
* “Create API for workspace invite”

---

## 5. Not Using Status Properly

**Mistake**

Everything stays in “Todo”.

**Why it hurts**

You lose progress visibility and motivation.

**Correct approach**

Move tasks through:

* Todo
* In Progress
* Blocked
* Completed

Progress is a psychological reward system.

---

## 6. Ignoring Weekly Reset

**Mistake**

Never reviewing completed or outdated tasks.

**Why it hurts**

Your system slowly fills with noise.

**Correct approach**

Once per week:

* Archive finished tasks
* Delete irrelevant ones
* Re-prioritize next week

This keeps Focura **light and fast**.

---

## 7. Using Focura Like a Chat Tool

**Mistake**

Long discussions inside tasks.

**Why it hurts**

Tasks become unreadable and slow.

**Correct approach**

* Keep comments short
* Record decisions, not conversations

---

## 8. Tracking Time for Everything

**Mistake**

Logging time on trivial tasks.

**Why it hurts**

Tracking overhead becomes friction.

**Correct approach**

Track time only for:

* Billable work
* Deep work sessions
* Performance analysis

---

## The Rule of Focura

**If the system feels heavy — you are using it wrong.**

Focura should feel:

* Fast
* Clear
* Minimal
* Execution-focused

Not complex.
