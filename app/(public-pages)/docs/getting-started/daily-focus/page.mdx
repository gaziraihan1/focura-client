# Daily Focus Flow

Daily focus is where Focura moves from planning to execution.

The goal is not to create a perfect plan.
The goal is to **decide once, then work without thinking about what to do next**.

This page shows how to run a focused day using Focura.

---

## The Core Idea

Most distraction comes from repeated decisions:

* What should I work on now?
* Is this the right task?
* Should I switch?

Focura removes these questions by helping you **choose your focus before you start**.

Once focus is set, your only job is execution.

## Start Your Day in 3 Minutes

You do not need a long planning session.

Each morning:

1. Open your workspace
2. Review your tasks
3. Choose **one primary focus task**
4. (Optional) Choose one secondary task
5. Start working

That’s it.

If planning takes more than 3 minutes, you are overthinking.

---

## Choose One Primary Focus

Your primary focus task should be:

* Meaningful
* Finishable today
* Worth uninterrupted attention

This task defines the success of your day.

If nothing else gets done, finishing this task still counts as progress.

---

## Limit Secondary Tasks

Secondary tasks exist to support your day, not fill it.

Rules:

* Maximum 1–2 secondary tasks
* Lower energy or shorter work
* Never compete with your primary focus

If everything feels important, reduce the list.

---

## Work in Focus Blocks

Instead of multitasking, work in **clear focus blocks**.

Recommended structure:

* 25–50 minutes focused work
* 5–10 minutes break
* Repeat as needed

During a focus block:

* Do not change tasks
* Do not reorganize your list
* Do not plan ahead

Execution only.

---

## Handle Interruptions Without Losing Focus

Interruptions will happen.

When they do:

* Capture the thought or task quickly
* Do not act on it immediately
* Return to your focus block

Focura is not about eliminating distractions.
It is about **recovering focus quickly**.

---

## Midday Check (Optional)

Once per day, briefly ask:

* Is my primary focus still valid?
* Did priorities shift?

If yes, adjust once and move on.

Avoid constant reprioritization — it destroys momentum.

---

## End the Day Light

At the end of your workday:

1. Mark completed tasks
2. Note unfinished work
3. Stop

Do not redesign tomorrow’s plan.

Focura favors **ending with clarity**, not exhaustion.

## Common Focus Mistakes

### Switching Too Often

Changing tasks resets mental context.

Protect your focus block unless there is a real reason to switch.

---

### Overloading the Day

More tasks do not mean more progress.

A focused day with one completed meaningful task is a success.

---

### Using Planning as Procrastination

Rearranging tasks can feel productive.

It is not.

If you are planning instead of working, reduce the list and start.

---

## What a Successful Day Looks Like

A good Focura day feels:

* Calm
* Intentional
* Finite

You know what you are doing.
You know when you are done.

That is the purpose of daily focus.

## What Comes Next

Once daily focus feels natural, the next step is learning how to reset and prepare for the next cycle.
