# Your First Task (The Right Way)

Your first task in Focura is not about filling a list.

It is about learning how to define work so that it is **clear, actionable, and finishable**.

A well-defined task reduces hesitation and makes starting easier.

---

## What a Task Represents

In Focura, a task is:

**The smallest meaningful unit of progress.**

It should answer one simple question:

**“What exactly needs to be done next?”**

If a task cannot be started immediately, it is probably too vague.

---

## Create Your First Task

Inside your workspace:

1. Open your project (or create one if needed)
2. Click **Add Task**
3. Write a short, specific title
4. Save

Do not add many tasks yet.

Start with **one task you can finish today**.

---

## How to Write a Good Task Title

A good task is:

* Specific
* Actionable
* Clear without extra explanation

### Good Examples

* “Write hero section copy”
* “Fix login validation error”
* “Review API response structure”
* “Study binary search for 30 minutes”

### Weak Examples

* “Work on project”
* “Improve app”
* “Study”
* “Do coding”

If you cannot see the first action, the task is not ready.

---

## The 5–30 Minute Rule

Your first tasks should ideally take:

**5 to 30 minutes**

Why:

* Easy to start
* Easy to complete
* Builds momentum quickly

Large tasks create resistance.
Small, clear tasks create movement.

---

## Set One Priority

After creating your first task:

Choose **one** task as your current focus.

Not three.
Not five.

Just one.

Focura is designed to reduce competing priorities so your attention stays intact.

---

## What Happens After You Complete It

Completion is not just a checkbox.

It does three things:

* Builds trust in your system
* Creates visible progress
* Reduces mental clutter

Your goal for the first day is simple:

**Create one task → Finish it → Feel the system working.**

---

## Common Beginner Mistakes

### Adding Too Many Tasks

Long lists feel productive but usually delay execution.

Start with a short list you can realistically finish.

---

### Writing Vague Tasks

If the task requires thinking before starting, it is too abstract.

Make the first action obvious.

---

### Turning Tasks Into Projects

If a task contains multiple steps, split it.

Example:

Bad:
“Build authentication system”

Better:

* Design login UI
* Implement email/password login
* Add error handling

---

## A Simple First-Day Setup

For your first session:

1. Create one project
2. Add 3–5 small tasks
3. Select one as your focus
4. Complete it before adding more

This establishes the habit of **finishing before expanding**.
