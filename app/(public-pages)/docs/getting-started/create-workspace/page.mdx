# Create Your First Workspace

Your workspace is the foundation of how you use Focura.

It represents a **focused environment** where related work lives together — not a place to store everything you might do someday.

Think of a workspace as a **container for one area of responsibility**.

Examples:

* Personal Productivity
* Startup / Product
* Learning Programming
* Client Projects
* Gym or Health Planning

The goal is separation of context, not organization for its own sake.

## Before You Create One

Avoid the common mistake of creating too many workspaces.

Start with **one**.

You can always split later, but starting with multiple spaces usually leads to:

* Fragmented attention
* Duplicate tasks
* Decision fatigue

If you are unsure, create a single workspace called:

**“Main Focus”**

## How to Create a Workspace

1. Open the sidebar
2. Click **New Workspace**
3. Enter a clear name
   Choose something outcome-oriented, not vague
4. (Optional) Add a short description
5. Create

That’s enough to begin.

Do not configure everything immediately.

## Naming Guidelines (Important)

Good workspace names:

* “Focura Product”
* “DSA Preparation”
* “Client Projects”
* “Health & Training”

Bad workspace names:

* “Tasks”
* “Work”
* “Random”
* “New Workspace”

A good name answers:

**What responsibility does this space represent?**

---

## What Belongs Inside a Workspace

A workspace should contain:

* Projects related to the same outcome
* Tasks that compete for the same time or energy
* Work that shares context

Example:

**Startup Workspace**

* Build landing page
* Fix onboarding flow
* Prepare investor notes

Everything inside should feel mentally connected.

---

## What Should NOT Go Inside

Avoid mixing unrelated areas such as:

* Personal errands
* Deep technical work
* Learning goals
* Team responsibilities

When contexts collide, focus drops.

If something feels unrelated, it probably belongs in another workspace later.

---

## Recommended First Structure

After creating your first workspace:

1. Add **one project**
2. Add **3–5 meaningful tasks**
3. Set a clear priority for one task
4. Ignore the rest for now

Your objective is not organization.

Your objective is to **start executing quickly**.

---

## Common Beginner Mistakes

### Creating Too Many Workspaces

This creates artificial separation and constant switching.

Start small.

---

### Using a Workspace as Storage

A workspace is for **active responsibility**, not an archive of ideas.

---

### Over-Planning Before Doing

Many users spend 30–60 minutes organizing before starting any work.

Instead:

Create → Add one project → Start a real task.

---

## What Happens Next

Once your first workspace exists, the next step is:

**Create your first task the right way.**

That is where Focura begins to shape your daily execution, not just your structure.
