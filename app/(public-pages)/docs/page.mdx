# Focura Documentation

These docs will help you:

- Understand how Focura thinks
- Adopt workflows that actually work
- Avoid common productivity traps
- Get results without burning out

## Learn the Focura Method

Focura is built around **systems, not features**.

Explore real-world workflows:

- **Solo founders** managing chaos
- **Developers** protecting deep work
- **Students** balancing learning and life
- **Small teams** staying aligned without micromanagement

<Callout type="info">
These workflows show how Focura **should be used** — not just what buttons to click.
</Callout>

---

## Use Features Intentionally

Every feature in Focura exists for a reason.

Our feature docs explain:

- **Why** the feature exists
- **When** to use it
- **When not to**

<Callout type="warning">
If a feature doesn't help you focus, you don't need it.
</Callout>
